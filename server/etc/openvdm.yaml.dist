# The transferInterval defines the interval for performing collectionSystemTransfer.
# The unit is in minutes.

# The gearmanServer is the location and port number for the Gearman server used in

# The plugins section defines where the plugins processing scripts reside
# and the expected suffix for each processing file.  It should include 2 directives:
